        <h1>Site Project Reflection</h1>
        <a href="https://klmerritt44.github.io/it-pearl/mini-site/index.html" class="tagline">Buffalo River Adventure Guide</a>

        <p>Looking back on this project, I have mixed feelings about my work. While I completed the core requirements, I know I could have pushed myself further. I struggled with motivation throughout the process, which made it difficult to stay engaged and bring my full creativity to the table.</p>
        <h2>Challenges and Peer Feedback</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest challenges for me was feeling stuck in a rut. I started this project with a lot of enthusiasm and got a pretty good start. But I found it difficult to work on it consistently, which impacted my final product. If I had been in a better mindset, I would have spent more time refining the design, improving functionality, and incorporating more advanced techniques. Instead, I found myself settling for the minimum rather than striving for the best and spending time learning and enjoying the process.</p>
        <p>A peer feedback session with my classmate, Rosy, turned into more of a heart-to-heart about tackling projects like this. We talked about procrastination and how easy it is to get stuck in a cycle of avoidance. Her feedback on my site was really helpful—she pointed out that I needed a “Back to Top” button and that some of my images, especially on the Cabins and Camps page, were too grainy. I found a great back-to-top button on CodePen and used Piklr instead of GIMP for photo editing, which made it much easier to balance file size and image quality.</p>
        <h2>Technical Growth and Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>Another <strong>major</strong> challenge was integrating the JavaScript API weather add-on. It turned out to be much more complex than I expected, but working through it was a valuable learning experience. I also used FormSpree for the first time instead of defaulting to WuFoo again. It was a small push outside my comfort zone, but it felt good to try something new.</p>
        <p>Despite my struggles, this project reinforced my technical skills—translating wireframes into structured HTML, ensuring semantic markup, and styling the page logically. It was also a valuable refresher on the full web development process. I’ve realized I need more discipline, especially in sticking to the wireframe. Improvising is fine, but planning ahead saves dev work later. This type of work is easy to underestimate—it’s multidisciplinary, requiring problem-solving, organization, and a positive mindset. I tend to learn things the hard way, but that’s part of the process. I need to stop waiting for the perfect time, place, or conditions and just do the work. Moving forward, I’ll focus on better planning, breaking tasks into smaller steps, and using a reward system to stay motivated.</p>
        <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>While this wasn’t my best work, it was a solid learning experience. It’s time to start feeling better about my work—I’m tired of feeling bad. I’m ready to regain my motivation and create work I can be proud of.</p>

        <h1>Progressive Enhancement is My Jam!</h1>
        <p>It prioritizes accessibility, performance, and a better user experience for everyone, regardless of their device, browser, or internet connection.</p>
        <h2>Content: The Heart of Progressive Enhancement</h2>
        <p>I love progressive enhancement because it focuses on content first. A solid HTML foundation ensures accessibility, and good markup improves usability. Even in CMS-driven environments, ensuring core content is always accessible should be the goal.</p>
        <h2>The Layers of Progressive Enhancement</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>HTML: The Foundation – Ensures content is accessible on any browser.</li>
          <li>CSS: The Visual Layer – Enhances styling without affecting usability.</li>
          <li>JavaScript: The Extras – Adds interactivity but remains non-essential.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Why does progressive enhancment matter (still)?</h2>
        <h3>Performance Matters</h3>
        <p>Websites relying too much on JavaScript suffer from slow load times. Progressive enhancement keeps sites lean and fast, as seen with YouTube, which ensures video playback works even when JavaScript is off.</p>
        <h3>Accessibility Matters</h3>
        <p>HTML-first development improves screen reader support and keyboard navigation. Starbucks, for example, prioritizes accessibility with progressive enhancement.</p>

          <h2>Progressive Enhancement in Practice</h2>
        
          <article id="navigation-menus">
            <h3>Navigation Menus</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Baseline:</strong> A simple HTML <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> with links ensures core navigation always works.</li>
              <li><strong>Enhanced:</strong> CSS improves layout and styling for better readability.</li>
              <li><strong>Further Enhanced:</strong> JavaScript adds a dropdown menu for mobile users, but the links still function without it.</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        
          <article id="images-media">
            <h3>Images & Media</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Baseline:</strong> A standard <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag ensures images load everywhere.</li>
              <li><strong>Enhanced:</strong> CSS <code>@supports</code> applies modern image styles only if the browser can handle them.</li>
              <li><strong>Further Enhanced:</strong> JavaScript lazy loads images for performance, but the site remains functional without it.</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        
          <article id="css-supports">
            <h3>Using <code>@supports</code> for Smart Enhancements</h3>
            <p>When you're using newer CSS features, progressive enhancement remains key:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use <strong>CSS feature detection</strong> (<code>@supports</code>) to apply styles only when supported.</li>
              <li>Provide <strong>fallbacks</strong> for unsupported features.</li>
              <li>Use <strong>JavaScript as a polyfill</strong> only when necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>GitHub’s responsive design follows this principle, keeping its interface functional on all devices.</p>

        <h1>Unprogressive Non-Enhancement?</h1>
        <p>A little part of me wants to troll the JavaScript-heavy developer bros by advocating for unprogressive non-enhancement—which means not adding unnecessary JavaScript when the browser already does the job. For instance, arbitrairly adding an accordion feature to make the page shorter when it's not that long and the content is more usable when the user can actually scan the formatted copy as a whole. Clicking is a higher interaction cost than scrolling and scrolling is already built into the browser. (There are instances where accordions can help when the user may only be interested in one particular "tab".) </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> for a button.</li>
          <li>Use an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for a link.</li>
          <li>Use CSS for animations when possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why complicate things? JavaScript is amazing, but use it wisely. Default to native browser behavior and only enhance when needed.</p>
        <h2>The Big Takeaway</h2>
        <p>Don’t rely on JavaScript for essential features like navigation or content visibility. If your site breaks without JS, rethink your approach.</p>
        <p>Let’s build lean, accessible, and resilient websites that work everywhere. It’s not just best practice—it’s the right way to build for the web.</p>
        <p>And honestly? I just love HTML. I found this additional article related to PE called, "<a href="https://dev.to/quii/the-web-i-want-43o" title="Links opens to external site.">The Web I Want</a>" that covers the importance of telling clients "No" but explaining the why behind it because at the end of the day <q>... the goal of most websites is delivering useful textual content, and all you really need for that is HTML.</q></p>
